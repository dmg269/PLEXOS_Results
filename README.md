# PLEXOS_Results
A repository for researchers at NAU working with PLEXOS results using the package rplexos
Currently, NAU is working on several projects involving PLEXOS results. In these projects we are interested in extracting results focused on cost, reliability, emissions, water use and generation change. The code included in this repository will be focused on this information.
